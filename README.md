## ðŸ“Œ Challenge Overview

Design and implement an **e-commerce system** with the following features:

âœ… **Product Management**
- Define products with:
  - Name, price, and quantity.
  - Support for both expirable (e.g., Cheese, Biscuits) and non-expirable (e.g., TV, Mobile) items.
  - Some products may require shipping (e.g., Cheese, TV) while others may not (e.g., Mobile scratch cards). Every shippable item provides its weight.

âœ… **Shopping Cart**
- Customers can add products to a cart with a specific quantity (not exceeding available stock).

âœ… **Checkout Process**
- Print checkout details in the console:
  - Order subtotal (sum of item prices)
  - Shipping fees
  - Paid amount (subtotal + shipping)
  - Customerâ€™s balance after payment

- Handle errors for:
  - Empty cart
  - Insufficient customer balance
  - Out-of-stock or expired products

âœ… **Shipping Service**
- Collect all items needing shipping and send them to a `ShippingService` that accepts objects implementing an interface:
  - `String getName()`
  - `double getWeight()`
